The second time I am making a flash card app. The first one was very clunky and very crowded. A bit of time has passed and now I will attempt another flash card app, this time a lot simpler and hopefully will perform a lot smoother.

## Planned Modes:

[ ] 1) Lesson Mode (lvl 0): User is presented with a set number of cards to learn

[ ] 2) Challenge Mode: User is tested based on the cards exposed to them, difficulty level based on how many times they have gotten it correct.

[ ] + Multiple Choice (lvl 1) : User is presented 4 choices
  
[ ] + Character Choice (lvl 2) : User is presented with a set amount of characters to answer with
  
[ ] + Key-in (lvl 3) : User must type in the answer
  
[ ] 3) EX Challenge Mode: User is tested based on the cards exposed to them, unavailable until enough cards are learned

[ ] + Form a Sentence (EX 1) : User must form a sentence with the given words, user must check it on their own.
  
[ ] + Type of Verb (EX 2) : User must determine what type of verb it is.
  
[ ] 4) Settings :

[ ] + Add : Add new cards
  
[ ] + Edit/Remove : Edit or remove cards
  
[ ] + Clear : removes all info
  
[ ] + Default data : populates default data
