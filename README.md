The second time I am making a flash card app. The first one was very clunky and very crowded. A bit of time has passed and now I will attempt another flash card app, this time a lot simpler and hopefully will perform a lot smoother.

## Planned Modes:

### [ ] 1) Learn Mode: User is presented with a set number of cards to learn


### [ ] 2) Hone Mode: User practices a set number of cards that they have previously learned


### [ ] 3) Ordeal Mode: User is tested based on the cards exposed to them, difficulty level based on how many times they have gotten it correct.

[ ] + Weighted: cards presented are based on how many times it has been correctly guessed by the user

[ ] + Multiple Choice (lvl 1) : User is presented 4 choices
  
[ ] + Character Choice (lvl 3) : User is presented with a set amount of characters to answer with
  
[ ] + Key-in (lvl 5) : User must type in the answer
  
[ ] + Type of Verb (EX 1) : User must determine what type of verb it is.


### [ ] 4) Records : Shows User stats

  
### [ ] 5) Settings

[ ] + Add : Add new cards
  
[ ] + Edit/Remove : Edit or remove cards
  
[ ] + Clear : removes all info
  
[ ] + Default data : populates default data


#### Stretch Goal:
Ordeal: Form a Centence
Ordeal: Kanji Writing
