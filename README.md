The second time I am making a flash card app. The first one was very clunky and very crowded. A bit of time has passed and now I will attempt another flash card app, this time a lot simpler and hopefully will perform a lot smoother.

## Planned Modes:

[X] 1) Learn Mode: User is presented with a set number of cards to learn

[X] 2) Hone Mode: User is presented with a set number of cards to review

[ ] 3) Challenge Mode: User is tested based on the cards exposed to them, difficulty level based on how many times they have gotten it correct.

[X] + Multiple Choice (lvl 1) : User is presented 4 choices
  
[X] + Key-in (lvl 1) : User must type in the answer

[ ] + Form a Sentence (EX 1) : User must form a sentence with the given words, checked with google translate
  
[ ] + Type of Verb (EX 2) : User must determine what type of verb it is.

[ ] + Kanji Drawing( EX 3) : User tries to properly write kanji

  
[ ] 4) Settings :

[ ] + Add : Add new cards
  
[ ] + Search: Search the card database and either Edit or remove cards
  
[ ] + Clear : removes all info
  
[ ] + Default data : populates default data
